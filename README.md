# Bikesharing
Analysis of a bike-sharing program in NYC for starting the same program at Des Moines.

#### Background
After analysing the data of NYC Citibike sharing program through Tableau, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

After doing the necassary conversion of trip duration in the jupyter notebook, we started to build the story. Our main purpose is to the Investors:
- the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

And finally, weâ€™ll add these new visualizations to our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. The link to the story is below:
